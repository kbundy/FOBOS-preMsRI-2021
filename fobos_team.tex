\end{center}

\smallskip

\noindent We have built a strong team of astronomers, statisticians, and
engineers critical to the success of the Keck-FOBOS project, as follows:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item {\bf Kevin Bundy (UCO)} is the Principle Investigator, responsible
for the overall leadership and success of the project.\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf Kyle Westfall (UCO)} is the Project Scientist, responsible
for continued development and refinement of FOBOS's science
requirements, including coordinating science-team efforts.  He will also
lead development of the FOBOS data systems.\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf Nicholas MacDonald (UCO)} is the Lead Engineer, responsible
for leading the optomechanical design of the instrument and working with
WMKO staff to ensure successful deployment of FOBOS on the Keck II
telescope.\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf Maureen Savage (UCO)} is the Project Manager, responsible for
maintaining the FOBOS development schedule and budget.  She coordinates
development of the full project work breakdown structure and project
documentation.\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf Renate Kupke (UCO)} is the Instrument Scientist, responsible
for ensuring that the instrument meets the FOBOS science
requirements.\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf Chad Schafer (CMU)} is the Data-Science Coordinator,
responsible for consulting on state-of-the-art solutions to FOBOSâ€™s
data-science challenges and the efforts of the FOBOS science teams in
this regard. Schafer brings invaluable expertise as the co-chair of the
LSST Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration.\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf John O'Meara (WMKO)} is the Chief Scientist for the
W.~M.~Keck Observatory.  He will coordinate with the Project Scientist
to ensure that the science requirements of FOBOS also meet the larger
scientific goals of WMKO.\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf Marc Kassis (WMKO)} is the instrument program manager at the
W.~M.~Keck Observatory, coordinating all instrument development for the
WMKO.  He will coordinate with the FOBOS instrument team and the WMKO
staff regarding the FOBOS design and telescope-integration plan, given
the full scope of Keck's development projects.\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf Jon Lawrence (AAO-MQ)} is Head of Instrumentation of
Australian Astronomical Optics at Macquarie University and integral to
the development of the Starbugs technology.  He and his team, with
additional optical design consultations from {\bf Will Saunders (AAO)},
will complete their design of the FOBOS Starbugs system.\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf Lisa Hunter (UCSC)} is the Director of Institute for
Scientist and Engineer Educators (ISEE) and Director of the Akamai
Workforce Initiative (AWI) in Hawai'i. She will work with the instrument
and science teams to organize our Akamai internships and Professional
Development Programs.
%
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\noindent In addition to the instrument-development team, we have
convened three {\bf science teams}, one for each of the main science
themes of our proposal:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item {\bf Dark-Energy Science Team}: Peter Capak (CalTech), Rachel
Mandelbaum (CMU), Dan Masters (JPL), Jeffrey Newman (Pitt), Markus
Michael Rau (CMU), and Jason Rhodes (JPL).\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf Proto-Galaxy Ecosystem Science Team}: George Becker (UCR),
Alison Coil (UCSD), Michael Cooper (UCI), J. Xavier Prochaska (UCSC),
Alice Shapley (UCLA), and Gillian Wilson (UCR).\\[-5pt]
%
\item {\bf Local Group Science Team}: Puragra Guhathakurta (UCSC), R.
Michael Rich (UCLA), Connie Rockosi (UCSC), Laura Sales (UCR), Daniel
Weisz (UCB), and Yuan-Sen Ting (Princeton).
